# EX 2A BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Python program to solve the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking, where the rat must find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a maze represented by a 2D matrix.


## Algorithm
Start the program.

Initialize the maze as a 4 Ã— 4 grid, where 1 represents a valid path and 0 represents a blocked path.

Create a solution matrix sol of the same size, initialized with 0.

Define a function isSafe(maze, x, y) to check if the current cell (x, y) is within bounds and open (1).

Define a recursive function solveMazeUtil(maze, x, y, sol) that:

Marks the current cell (x, y) in sol.

Checks if the destination (N-1, N-1) is reached; if yes, return True.

Moves forward in the maze by:

Trying the downward move (x+1, y).

Trying the rightward move (x, y+1).

If both moves fail, backtrack by resetting sol[x][y] = 0 and return False.

In the main function solveMaze(maze):

Call solveMazeUtil(maze, 0, 0, sol).

If a solution exists, print the solution matrix.

Otherwise, display "Solution doesn't exist".

Stop the program.

    return False

    maze = [ [1, 0, 0, 0],
             [1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 1, 0, 0],
             [1, 1, 1, 1] ]
